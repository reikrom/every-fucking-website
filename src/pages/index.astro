                    Forget that! Who would ever want to put in all of that
                    effort for a website? Just open up your web browser and type
                    "bootstrap template" into your favorite search engine, like
                    Yahoo! or Bing, and you're on your way! There are hundreds
                    of templates to choose from, but go ahead and pick this same
                    exact template from the first result on google, edit a few
                    lines, and you're on your way! No one will notice!
